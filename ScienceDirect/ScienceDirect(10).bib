This chapter discusses the causes of memory interference and the extent of situations in which these mechanisms operate. First, the chapter discusses some widely held assumptions about the situation of interference, focusing on the idea that such effects arise from competition for access via a shared retrieval cue. This notion is sufficiently general that it may be applied in a variety of interference settings, which is illustrated briefly. Then the classical interference paradigms from which these ideas emerged are reviewed. The chapter also reviews more recent phenomena that both support and challenge classical conceptions of interference. These phenomena provide compelling illustrations of the generality of interference and, consequently, of the importance of understanding its mechanisms. A recent perspective on interference is highlighted that builds upon insights from modern work, while validating intuitions underlying several of the classical interference mechanisms. According to this new perspective, forgetting derives not from acquiring new memories per se, but from the impact of later retrievals of the newly learned material. After discussing findings from several paradigms that support this retrieval-based view, the chapter illustrates how forgetting might be linked to inhibitory processes underlying selective attention.}

abstract = {The uncomputable parts of thinking (if there are any) can be studied in much the same spirit that Turing (1950) suggested for the study of its computable parts. We can develop precise accounts of cognitive processes that, although they involve more than computing, can still be modelled on the machines we call ‘computers’. In this paper, I want to suggest some ways that this might be done, using ideas from the mathematical theory of uncomputability (or Recursion Theory). And I want to suggest some uses to which the resulting models might be put. (The reader more interested in the models and their uses than the mathematics and its theorems, might want to skim or skip the mathematical parts.)
Résumé
Les éléments du raisonnement ne relevant pas du calculable (uncomputable), (s'il en existe), peuvent s'etudier dans I'optique suggérée par Turing (1950) pour l'étude des éléments calculables (computable). On peut rendre compte avec précision des processus cognitifs qui, bien qu'impliquant plus que des calculs, peuvent cependant être modélisés sur ordinateurs. Dans cet article l'auteur propose des modalités pour arriver à ces résultats en utilisant les idées de la théorie mathdmatique de la Récursion (uncomputability). L'auteur suggère aussi des utilisations pour les modéles que en découlent (Il est possible au lecteur plus intéressé par les modèles et leurs utilisations que par les mathématiques et les théorèmes de passer rapidement sur la partie mathématique ou d'omettre de la lire.)}
